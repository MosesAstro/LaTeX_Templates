% Understanding textblocks is the key to being able to do a poster in
% LaTeX. In
%
%    \begin{textblock}{wid}(x,y)
%    ...
%    \end{textblock}
%
% the first argument gives the block width in units of the grid
% cells specified above in \TPGrid; the second gives the (x,y)
% position on the grid, with the y axis pointing down.

% You will have to do a lot of previewing to get everything in the 
% perfect place.

% This gives good title positioning for a portrait poster.
% Watch out for hyphenation in titles - LaTeX will do it
% but it looks awful.

% This puts a small textblock on the right-hand side upper corner to
% allow passers-by to look up the abstract number and authors and

% the {4.2}(0,1) indicates the size and position of the textblock. You'll want to 
% adjust these until things look good for your particular poster. When you find an
% arrangement you like, these will probably not change a lot from year-to-year.

  \Head{Introduction}
  %\slshape
  \small
  This template is created to help those who use \LaTeX\ write LPSC posters that look decent, are output as scaleable PDFs, and can be printed by most modern large-format printers with little or no fiddling.
  
  I turned off paragraph indentation. 
  If you want it back on, look at the preamble and comment out the \verb=\parindent= command. 
  Also, you can do citations just like normal \cite{kopka2003guide}.
  
  Here is some nonsense text to fill in this box.
  \blindtext
  \bigskip
\end{textblock}

\begin{textblock}{4.2}(0,12.2)
  \Head{Left Section Header}
  %\slshape
  \small
  You use citations and references exactly as you would for any \LaTeX\ publication. 
  Here's our second and third citation \cite{light2004end,borland2007rainbow}. 
  And let's also cite \cite{green2011colour}.

\begin{table}
\caption{
\label{Col_Joints_Table}
  \small
 I would like to include a small table too. So let's do that:}
 \begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}{llll}
   \textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} & \textbf{Column 3} & \textbf{Confidence}\\
   \hline
   Just & Like & Any & Other\\
   Table & We & Can & Format\\
   This & As & We & Like.\\
   This & As & We & Like.\\
   This & As & We & Like.\\
   This & As & We & Like.\\
   This & As & We & Like.\\
   \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
  
  \bigskip
\end{textblock}

% Note that the Section styles here and below are \LHead rather than 
% \Head. That's because these are on the right-hand-side of the poster and 
% the \LHead command left-justifies the headers while the \Head command
% right-justifies the headers. If you don't like this, modify the lpscposter style file
% to fit your needs.

\begin{textblock}{4.2}(19,1.2)
  \LHead{Right Section Header}
  %\slshape
  \small 
  
  Remember that you don't want to overwhelm your viewers with text.
  Use a little bit of text to explain what you did, make the captions to your figures excessively helpful, and leave the rest for the conversation with people who come to your poster.
  If you intend to be absent from your poster during the session, leave a copy or a URL for a copy of your abstract, paper, etc., so interested people can find out more about what you did by downloading a copy of your abstract.
  
  Whatever you do, don't ask your viewers to ingest tons of text all at once; they'll go elsewhere. 
  The poster session is as much about networking as it is about presenting your results. 
  Do both verbally.
\end{textblock}

% Turn on box frame for this one textblock.
\TPshowboxestrue
\begin{textblock}{4.2}(19,12.2)
  \LHead{Concluding Remarks}
  %\slshape
  \small
  
  For the most part, you'll be fiddling with textblock positions and sizes to make things perfect. 
  Unfortunately, until you've written your entire poster, you won't know exactly where everything should fit or how large specific blocks should be. 
  You'll notice that in this template, the figures don't line up perfectly at the bottom but they do line up at the top. 
  If you want perfect alignment, you have to make your figures and their captions the same size. That seems like silly work to me.
  
  Be careful with showing the frames around boxes; you might be surprised at where frame boxes start and stop and how they overlap.

% The References section is just a textblock like all the others, but
% it contains the bibliography. This bibliography looks a lot like the LPSC
% abstract bibliography offered elsewhere by me because it's pretty much
% the same.

% Turn off the visible frame again.

% Position your figures in order of their reference within the document if you're using "Figure 1" notation.
% Note that this is not necessarily the same order as the appear left->right top->down on the
% poster unless you want it to be. Sometimes larger figures fit better in certain places even if
% that makes them appear to be out of place. Just be clear so your reader doesn't have to
% fight your poster to get information from it...
% I place the figures last in the LaTeX document because it's just easier for me to keep track 
% of where they are. It doesn't really matter, though, because we're not allowing them to float 
% as one would in a normal LaTeX document.
