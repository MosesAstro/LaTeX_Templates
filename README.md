# LaTeX_Templates

LPSCAbstractLaTeXTemplate is a template package for writing LPSC abstracts that match the LPI expected formatting and style.


LPSCPosterLaTeXTemplate is a poster template package that works well for me for LPSC and other conferences which provide poster boards for 42x42 or so posters. It's not terribly well-polished yet.
